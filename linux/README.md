I found the easiest way to complete this on Pop!_OS was to use the `key-mapper` package:

`sudo apt install key-mapper`

This then has a ui which you can use, selecting the keyboard in the dropdown at the top and then I swapped delete and pause.

There are plenty of alternatives if this doesn't work for you.

Edit 2024 - Now using linux mint - seems to be Input Remapper now (https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/12/remap-keyboard-and-mouse-buttons-on.html)
